# Project Overview
This project is a content‑based movie recommendation system built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
It recommends similar movies based on movie descriptions using TF‑IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. 
The backend is powered by FastAPI, and a simple Streamlit frontend is used for user interaction.The system also integrates
with the TMDB API to fetch movie posters and additional details, providing a richer user experience.
